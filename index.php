            <h1 class="h1">Marylin Monroe</h1>
            <p> A name that in itself is synonymous with glamour, mystery and elusive beauty. Her platinum curls,
                languid look and sensual smile are forever imprinted in the collective memory, becoming a symbol of an
                entire era.
                Her fragile beauty, reinforced by incredible charm, fascinated and disturbed at the same time.
            <p>Marylin was more than just a sex symbol; she was the embodiment of the American dream, its rise and fall,
                its hopes and disappointments. She left behind not only an amazing legacy in cinema, but also an eternal
                question:
                who was Marylin Monroe really? A mystery that continues to excite minds and inspire generations.
